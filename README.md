# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component solution

This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

My first challenge where I knew from the get-go (without having to read up first) what I needed to achieve with JS and how to do it. Since I have been struggling with JS so far, feeling confident was a pleasant change. Having turned one corner, many lie ahead.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

- Basic structure
- Basic styling
- Text-styling
- Footer elements styling
- JS for mobile design
- Mobile vs desktop design
- Tooltip styling
- JS for desktop design, adjustments to JS for mobile
- Finishing touches


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

I wanted to add some responsivity on resizing of browser window, so explored the window resize event a bit.

Having received some feedback on declaring variables, I am also making a habit of using const whenever possible/suitable.
